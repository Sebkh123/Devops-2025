# Exam report requirements

**Motivation**: The exam report is written by the group and will be read by me and the censor.

## Requirements

**Deadline**: Check the deadline on WiseFlow. Remember to create groups yourselves when you submit the report. The exam plan will be created based on the groups you create.

You are allowed to work on the project after handing in the report.

**Language**: Danish/English

**Length**: Max 8 pages

Rules per the study curriculum:

- A page is defined as 2400 characters (including spaces).

- Images are counted as much as the space that they take up. If you make the images too small to be read without digitally zooming in, then it will be considered as imcomprehensible.

Please add the necessary images and diagrams instead of writing 8 pages of text.

If you exceed the limit, then anything above the limit will not count towards the grade.

## Report formalities

The word "report" is just a name. Don't look at this as a document that requires a table of contents, introduction, abstract, synopsis, conclusion, etc. This is just a technical writeup that sets the stage for the exam. The report is not decisive for your grade. It is just to give the censor and I an idea of your project in advance. 

However, these are the formalities that your report must include:

- Group name (as per `repositories.py`) and student names with KEA mail and GitHub usernames (if applicable).

- Page numbers

- **Justify margins**: The entire report text (except titles) must be justified on both sides. To get you started, here is how you can do it in Google Docs and Word:

Justifying text helps readability and gives the report a professional look.

## Sections to include

Since the mandatories specify a set of documents that you must bring to the exam, it would be interesting to allow you complete freedom for the exam report. 

Giving an overview of the setup with diagram(s) is a good start, though.

My advice: Keep it concise!

## Use of language models

This course encourages you to use tools that might aid you in coding, debugging and correctly configuring your systems.

However, do **not** use AI to write the report. Even with proper prompting language models don't seem to be able to write in the concise manner required without losing meaning. The report is an excercise in trying to formulate the subject in a way that forces you to cut down to the heart of the subjects and what matters in this course.
