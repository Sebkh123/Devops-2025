# Monorepos

*The new old fad!*

Monorepo: Developers push code changes into a central repository. 

Monolithic vs. monorepo:

> "A related concept is the monolithic application, but whereas a monolith combines its sub-projects into one large project, a monorepo may contain multiple independent projects."

[Source: Wikipedia - Monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo)

# Advantages and disadvantages of monorepos?

**Hints**: In relation to large-scale applications, team collaboration, developers individually, in the context of version control and CI/CD. 

*Discuss in pairs*

# Monolithic applications vs. Microservices 

**Note**: that is not about monorepos. This relates to architecture. 

It's possible to have microservices in a monorepo. 

|                    | Monolithic          | Microservices               |
|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Running**        | Single application | Many small, one-responsibility services |
| **Internal Communication** | Within the same program | Inter-service communication over a network |



*Pros and cons?*

# Monolithic applications vs. Microservices - Pros and Cons

|            | Monolithic Applications                    | Microservices                           |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Pros**   | Simplicity in deployment and development.  | Scalability, flexibility, fault isolation.|
| **Cons**   | Scalability challenges, potential coupling.| Increased complexity in deployment, management.|


You will be creating a monolithic application this semester but a lot of companies are currently trying their hands on microservices.

# Last Years GitHub Universe

GitHub stores all their code in a single repository

# Google Research paper

Google stores all their code in a single repository. 

That's a billion files and billions lines of code.

They have experienced that this improves the quality of code checked in as wells as the reusability.
