# Exam requirements

This document is a to provide an overview of overall requirements without listing each one. It is a supplement to the course material and assignments on the semester plan.

Besides your individual exams a substantial part of the grade will be based on your project work during the semester but this includes implementation of the DevOps principles into your work.

# DevOps

This section is an attempt to make you aware of the non-functional requirements that are not directly mentioned in the assignment descriptions in the semester plan.

---

## What is DevOps (Theory)

The theory can be found in slides and the guest lecture. You may even supplement with your own reading on the subject. 

DevOps is not the technology we have learned, though we may use it to aide us in becoming DevOps. 

**Example**: you can use pipelines to help you achieve DevOps principles but pipelines are a concept that predates and exist independently from DevOps. Don't conflate the tooling and technology with the theory of DevOps. DevOps is a culture. It is about the people and the processes.

## What is DevOps to you?

Though there are truths - like the Weekly DevOps Principles slides - many supporting definitions and some conflicting exist. I cannot provide a single definition that you must memorize. And even if I could, it wouldn't be interesting to me.

It is up to each individual to formulate what being DevOps means to them. I hope that I have given you the tools to do so throughout the course.

## Be DevOps

In a way the course runs on two planes. The technological track [Technology](#technology) and the DevOps track [DevOps](#devops). The first track is easy to give tangible assignments for. The second track is something each group must constantly be aware of and intrinsically assignem themselves to work on.

## In case you werenâ€™t DevOps

Group work often fail in educational institutions and it would be dealt with differently at work places. This course is an attempt to give you tools to handle these situations.

I will generate graphs before the exam that represent the commit activity of each group member in order to gauge participation. This is meant for people who aren't participating much in their group. It isn't a measuring contest.

The goal is not to point fingers but to highlight the situation that has presented you with an excellent opportunity to put your DevOps principles into use such as [psychological safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety). 

During the group presentation I would like you to initiate the conversation by bringing it up. Rather than a negative it is seen as fortitude that you are able to analyze and reflect on real-world problems. This will show that not only have you learned the DevOps theory but managed to apply it to your own group situation.

# Technology

These are the functional requirements. All assignments in the semester plan that are not described as [Optional] must be completed.

---

## Tech stack

The server must be rewritten in another framework. You are not allowed to use `Flask`, `Express` or `Spring Boot`.

---

## Organization

Use version control.

Employ a branching strategy.

Have a way to manage issues.

To your best ability, create thorough documentation.

---

## Software quality

Ensure software quality (static analysis / linting).

You must perform testing.

---

## Automation

Setup a CI/CD pipeline.

---

## Monitoring

You must have monitoring.

---

## Deployment

Your application must be deployed to a Virtual Machine or similar. Services like Web Apps or PaaS like Vercel etc. are great and easy to use, but it removes your chance to learn about topics such as server management, maintenance and upkeep.

While not required to implement it, you must've discussed scaling and an optimal deployment strategy in your groups.

---

## Production

Your system must be deployed for the exam.

---
---
---

# Other Requirements

You must have all your group data filled out in the `repositories.py` file. This must be done exactly when you are asked to do it in the course preparation.

---

## Learning goals

The learning goals are designed to help you understand at what level you should know the content.

While the general content of the slides is mandatory knowledge, sources and external links (included in the slides) are not required reading unless explicitly mentioned in the semester plan / slides.
