# What folders and files should never be pushed?

*And why?*

---

# Folders and files that should never be pushed

IDE preferences that are user specific should not be forced upon others:

  - JetBrains creates the `.idea`. 
  - VSCode creates `.vscode`. 

OS specific files should not be pushed:

  - MacOS creates `.DS_Store` folders that relate to Finder settings. 
  - Windows creates `Thumbs.db` to cache folder thumbnails.

Build artifacts relating to the programming language should not be pushed:

  - Python: `__pycache__`.
  - Node.js: `node_modules`.

# .gitignore.io

[gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/) is a website that generates `.gitignore` files for you.

---

# Why you would also want to use a global .gitignore

If it relates to your IDE or OS and not the codebase itself, it should be in a global .gitignore.

---

# Add to the global .gitignore: \*nix

Check if file exists:

```bash
$ git config --global core.excludesfile
```

Modify the file:

```bash
$ nano ~/.gitignore
```

Configure the file (tell Git to use it, remember to point correctly to the file):

```bash
$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
```

---

# Add to the global .gitignore: Windows

Check if file exists:

```powershell
$ git config --global core.excludesfile
```

Modify the file:

```powershell
$ notepad C:\Users\YourUsername\.gitignore_global
```

Configure the file (tell Git to use it):

```powershell
$ git config --global core.excludesfile C:\Users\YourUsername\.gitignore_global
```

# Git advice - write proper commit messages - I

* **Clarity**: Explains changes for team members and future reference.
* **Tracking**: Aids in understanding project evolution and change history.
* **Review Efficiency**: Simplifies code reviews by clearly explaining changes.
* **Debugging Aid**: Helps pinpoint when and why changes were made for troubleshooting.
* **Documentation**: Acts as a record for future reference, helpful for new team members.
* **Professionalism**: Reflects disciplined, best practice approach in software development.

# Git advice - write proper commit messages - II

Personal suggestion (this is how I do it, it helps me, you are not required to follow it):

`<past_tense_verb> + <action>`

Examples: 

- Refactored the integration tests

- Created a dark mode feature

- Implemented a POST /users route

- Fixed the bug in the login form

*Can you come up with more commit messages that follow this structure?*

# It's time to decide on your own conventions!

Agree with your group either verbally or in writing. 

Example of what a professional style guide looks like:

https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/

You will have to develop a style as you go along but you will soon appreciate naming consistency.
